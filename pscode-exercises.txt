// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. ASK for a number
2. STORE input from 1 in a variable named num
3. IF (num % 2 == 0), THEN PRINT "Even"
4. ELSE PRINT "ODD"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

**Steps for getting 5 numbers**
1. DO the following sub-steps 5 times:
	A. ASK for number
	B. STORE input from A in a variable named (num1 - num5)

**Steps for getting average**
2. SUM num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
3. STORE result from Step 2 in a variable named sum
4. DIVIDE sum by 5
5. STORE result from Step 4 in a variable named average

**Steps for finding smallest**
6. COMPARE num1 and num2 AND RETURN smallest
7. COMPARE Step 6 Result and num3, RETURN smallest
8. COMPARE Step 7 Result and num4, RETURN smallest
9. COMPARE Step 8 Result and num5, RETURN smallest
10. STORE Step 9 Result as a variable  named smallestNum

**Steps for finding largest**
11. COMPARE num1 and num2 AND RETURN largest
12. COMPARE Step 6 Result and num3, RETURN largest
13. COMPARE Step 7 Result and num4, RETURN largest
14. COMPARE Step 8 Result and num5, RETURN largest
15. STORE Step 9 Result as a variable  named largestNum

**Steps for writing results**
16. PRINT `The average of ${num1}, ${num2}, ${num3}, ${num4}, ${num5} is ${average}.`
17. PRINT `The smallest of ${num1}, ${num2}, ${num3}, ${num4}, ${num5} is ${smallestNum}.`
18. PRINT `The largest of ${num1}, ${num2}, ${num3}, ${num4}, ${num5} is ${largestNum}.`

Note: ${} means show the value of the variable enclosed in the curly brackets.
